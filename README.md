# How to install

### _Step 1_: Install the theme

Double-click or drag and drop the file in Playnite to install it or install it from Playnite using the Add-ons Menu(F9)<br>

* [eMixedNiteMC 3.96](https://github.com/MCC321-QC/eMixedNiteMC/releases/download/v3.96/eMixedNiteMC_3_96.pthm)<br>
<br>


### _Step 2_: Configure your Settings

(_recommended_ **Updated with v3.91**)<br>
I share the settings I use so you can get the same result as in the showcased screenshots.
I strongly recommend that you test all the options so you can personalize it like you want.
Don't forget that you need the extension [ThemeModifier](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-thememodifier-plugin) to edit/save any settings. You can use the
"Quick settings wheels" to have quick access to some settings. When you have the desired settings,
hover your mouse cursor hover the settings you changed and you will see the value in a tooltip popup.
You can then enter your new settings in the constant menu of the extension [ThemeModifier](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-thememodifier-plugin).<br>

- [ ] You can use the arrow on your keyboard to change value one by one if you want to be more precise.<br>

- [ ] I recommend you use vertical cover images for better compatibility. (But you can adjust the settings to use other forms/ratio of covers)<br>

* [Playnite Settings](https://github.com/MCC321-QC/eMixedNiteMC/wiki)<br>
<br>


### _Step 3_: Install the title font

(_Optional_)<br>
You will also need the font I use to have the upper case letter style in the title. (_Font found in the SummerNite Theme_)
You can install it by just clicking the .ttf file but you will need to do it each time you restart your computer.
To fix this, you need to add the font to the registry too. You can do so by clicking the file called InstallFont.<br>

* [eMixedNiteMC Font](https://github.com/MCC321-QC/eMixedNiteMC/releases/download/v3.96/eMixedNiteMC_Font.zip)<br>
<br>


### _Final Step_: Set-up your platform icons

(_Optional_ **Updated with version 3.61**)<br>
The theme can show an icon based on the platform of the game on top of the Playnite banner (if enabled) or platform banner. For this you will need to set your 
icon for each platforms in order to load the icon on the banner correctly. I made a little collection (Not ready yet) so you don't need to search them all. 
To apply an icon, open the Library Manager(CTRL+W) and apply an icon for each platform by clicking on "Select Icon" in the icon section. You can also disable 
the library banner in the settings to show library icons on banners. Icons for most Library are also included in this theme.<br>

* [Platform Icons](#) (Coming soon!)<br>
<br>


## Conclusion:

You will see below the list of all the plugins this theme support, thanks to [darklinkpower](https://github.com/darklinkpower) for letting me use his code
from the [Stardust](https://github.com/darklinkpower/Stardust) theme that integrate the video trailer in eMixedNiteMC and finally a **big fat thanks** to [eminaguil](https://github.com/eminaguil) for
his awesome works and for letting me modify his theme.<br>

## Supported Plugins

These plugin are supported but **not needed**, feel free to only use the ones you are interested in. The only
extension I strongly recommend is [ThemeModifier](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-thememodifier-plugin) and [Theme Options](https://github.com/ashpynov/ThemeOptions) so you can edit/save settings and edit the color pattern.<br>

- [ ] Source/Platform Banners are include in eMixedNiteMC and are not loaded from the plugin [ThemeExtras](https://github.com/felixkmh/ThemeExtras-for-Playnite)<br>

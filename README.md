# How to install

### _Step 1_: Install the theme

Double-click or drag and drop the file in Playnite to install it or install it from Playnite using the Add-ons Menu(F9)<br>

* Link: [eMixedNiteMC 3.5](https://github.com/MCC321-QC/eMixedNiteMC/releases/download/v3.5/eMixedNiteMC_3_5.pthm)<br>
<br>


### _Step 2_: Configure your Settings

(_recommended_ **Updated with v3.0**)<br>
You should use the same settings as me so you can get the desired result.<br>
I strongly recommend that you use vertical cover for better compatibility.<br>
(But you can adjust the settings to use other forms of cover)<br>

* Link: [Playnite Settings](https://github.com/MCC321-QC/eMixedNiteMC/wiki)<br>
<br>


### _Step 3_: Install the title font

(_Optional_)<br>
You will also need the font I use to have the upper case letter style in the title. (_Font found in the SummerNite Theme_)<br>
You can install it by just clicking the .ttf file but you will need to do it each time you restart your computer.<br>
To fix this, you need to add the font to the registry too. You can do so by clicking the file called InstallFont.<br>

* Link: [eMixedNiteMC Font](https://github.com/MCC321-QC/eMixedNiteMC/releases/download/v3.5/eMixedNiteMC.Font.rar)<br>
<br>


### _Final Step_: Set-up your platform banners

(_not needed anymore after v3.0_)<br>
The theme will need you to set your banners for each Platform in order to load the banner correctly anywhere. I made a little collection so you don't need to search them all. To apply a banner, open the Library Manager(CTRL+W) and apply a banner for each platform by clicking on "Select Cover" in the cover section. The banners for each Launcher(_Library_) are already included in the theme. Most banners come from [this post](https://playnite.link/forum/thread-314.html) and all credits goes to the different authors.You can also add icon to your platform and they will appear on top of your Platform Banner if you desactivate Library Banner. Icon for each Library are also included in the theme.<br>
(_I changed the PSP banner because most PSP cover image are less wide than normal._)<br>

<br>


## Conclusion:

eMixedNiteMC work in most way the same as [eMixedNite](https://github.com/eminaguil/eMixedNite) and the same plugins are supported as well. You will<br>
see below the list of all the plugins this theme use. Thanks to [darklinkpower](https://github.com/darklinkpower) for letting me use his code<br>
from the [Stardust](https://github.com/darklinkpower/Stardust) theme that integrate the video trailer in eMixedNiteMC and finally a **big fat thanks** to [eminaguil](https://github.com/eminaguil) for<br>
